과제1\n","비지도 학습의 목적인 Grouping에 대해 자세히 설명해 주세요! Dataset을 Grouping한다는 것이 무슨 의미인지 간단히 서술해 주시고,\n","\n","세션에서 언급되었던 Grouping을 위한 두 수단에 대해서 예시 모델을 제시하여 설명해 주시면 됩니다! 예시 모델의 종류에 대해서는 구글링을 통해 조사할 수 있겠습니다.\n","\n","\n","Grouping is the prime feature of unsupervised learning, discovering hidden patterns in unlabelled datasets by identifying similarities between unlabelled datapoints and tying them up into a group. This grouping is an essential step to dividing a humongous piece of unlabelled dataset into digestible chunks for a machine learning system. There are two main grouping methods by which data is reduced: clustering and dimensionality reduction. In simple terms, clustering reduces the number of examples and dimensionality reduction reduces the number of dimensions of a dataset for machine learning. \n","\n","Given a set of examples, clustering divides this set into subsets of examples based on their similarities. K-means clustering is a key similarity measurement technique where random unlabelled samples are chosen as initial means and the K-means algorithm will iterate over certain calculations to create centroids until their convergence. The algorithm will then identify the k number of centroids to allocate datapoints to the nearest cluster without unnecessarily raising the number of centroids. In this way, the K-means clustering algorithm groups datapoints with their minimum variation from the cluster's centroid. K-means clustering works particularly well for cases where clusters are spherical, sufficiently separated, and have similar volumes as well as similar numbers of points. \n","\n","Dimensionality reduction, however, convert the dimension of a set of datapoints from 'd' to 'r' given r < d with summary indices, that retain the original information. The new values created under a smaller set of these summary indices are called principal components. These components are variables that are branches of the original variables, newly transformed through linear combinations. Principal Component Analysis, often abbreviated as PCA, executes this dimensionality reduction by finding an r-dimension projection that best preserves the variance between datapoints. The first step of PCA is to compute the mean vector µ and covariance matrix Σ of original datapoints. Then the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Σ will be computed. The top r eigenvectors will be selected, and the points will be projected onto the subspace spanned by these eigenvectors: y=A(x-µ) where y is the new point, x the original point, and rows of A represent the eigenvectors.\n","\n","\n","References: \n","1) https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/k-means-clustering/\n","2) https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/principal-component-analysis/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bfRSNJQ9yuJK","metadata":{"id":"bfRSNJQ9yuJK"},"source":["### 과제2\n","드라이브에 첨부된 diabetes.csv 파일을 이용해, decision tree를 이용한 classifier model을 디자인해 주세요!\n","\n","분류 문제에 맞는 (간단한 수준의) 데이터 전처리 및 Feature selection이 선행되어야 합니다.\n","\n","모델의 성능은 상관 없지만, 모델 구동 결과 및 평가지표의 출력은 정상적으로 이루어져야 합니다! 평가지표의 종류 또한 상관 없습니다.\n","\n","데이터셋에 대한 설명은 아래 캐클 링크를 참조해 주세요!\n","https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database\n","\n","과제 진행에 있어 어려움을 겪으신다면 아래 링크의 내용을 참조하시면 됩니다!\n","https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/decision-tree-classification-python\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":87,"id":"0d13cd95","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>pregnant</th>\n","      <th>glucose</th>\n","      <th>bp</th>\n","      <th>skin</th>\n","      <th>insulin</th>\n","      <th>bmi</th>\n","      <th>pedigree</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>148</td>\n","      <td>72</td>\n","      <td>35</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>33.6</td>\n","      <td>0.627</td>\n","      <td>50</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>85</td>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>29</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>26.6</td>\n","      <td>0.351</td>\n","      <td>31</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>183</td>\n","      <td>64</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>23.3</td>\n","      <td>0.672</td>\n","      <td>32</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>89</td>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>23</td>\n","      <td>94</td>\n","      <td>28.1</td>\n","      <td>0.167</td>\n","      <td>21</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>137</td>\n","      <td>40</td>\n","      <td>35</td>\n","      <td>168</td>\n","      <td>43.1</td>\n","      <td>2.288</td>\n","      <td>33</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   pregnant  glucose  bp  skin  insulin   bmi  pedigree  age  label\n","0         6      148  72    35        0  33.6     0.627   50      1\n","1         1       85  66    29        0  26.6     0.351   31      0\n","2         8      183  64     0        0  23.3     0.672   32      1\n","3         1       89  66    23       94  28.1     0.167   21      0\n","4         0      137  40    35      168  43.1     2.288   33      1"]},"execution_count":87,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Target variable: Outcome\n","# Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies a patient has had and one's BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n","# Goal: Building a machine learning model that predicts the diabetes outcome of a patient based on their given health information\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier #
